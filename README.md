# categorical_effect
Study of the malware detector for categorical calls
We implement Black Box attack to evaluate the performance of our proposed hybrid model.

###Introduction
We are adding the noise to the malware. The system has generator and discriminator. After adding noise at end, we create adversarial example. The idea is based on Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Black-Box Attacks Based on GAN by Weiwei Hu and Ying Tan.

## Data
Upon request, we can share.

## Models evaluated
Upon request, we can share.

### Generator
input: malware + noise
output: adversarial malware examples
